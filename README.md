## Branch conventions

A git branch should start with a category. Pick one of these: feature, bugfix, hotfix, or test.

- feature is for adding, refactoring or removing a feature
- bugfix is for fixing a bug
- hotfix is for changing code with a temporary solution and/or without following the usual process (usually because of an emergency)
- test is for experimenting outside of an issue/ticket

---

## Commit conventions

- feat is for adding a new feature
- fix is for fixing a bug
- refactor is for changing code for peformance or convenience purpose (e.g. readibility)
- chore is for everything else (writing documentation, formatting, adding tests, cleaning useless code etc.)
